echo ""
echo "This test verifies that the first check-in no longer causes screen freeze."
echo ""
echo "🔧 CHANGES MADE:"
echo ""
echo "1. ✅ Increased first point popup delay from 500ms to 1500ms"
echo "   - This prevents race conditions during first check-in"
echo "   - Gives the UI time to settle before showing popup"
echo ""
echo "2. ✅ Removed conflicting callback setup in app layout"
echo "   - App layout was setting empty callback"
echo "   - Dashboard screen was overriding it"
echo "   - Now only dashboard handles the callback"
echo ""
echo "3. ✅ Added timeout cleanup in callback"
echo "   - Clears any existing timeout before setting new one"
echo "   - Prevents multiple timeouts from stacking up"

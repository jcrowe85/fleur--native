echo "1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor"
echo "2. Run the SQL in database/restore_original_profiles.sql"
echo "3. This restores the original simple structure + adds missing columns"

echo "ðŸ“‹ WHAT THIS DOES:"
echo "- Restores the original profiles table structure"
echo "- Adds only the columns we actually need:"
echo "  â€¢ first_login (for first-time user tracking)"
echo "  â€¢ has_performed_first_action (for first point popup)"
echo "  â€¢ is_guest (for edge function compatibility)"
echo "- Keeps it simple - no duplicate columns or over-engineering"
echo ""
echo "âœ… This should work with the existing edge function"
echo "   (which I also simplified back to the original approach)"

echo "Press Enter to continue..."

echo "âœ… Run the restore script to get back to the working state."

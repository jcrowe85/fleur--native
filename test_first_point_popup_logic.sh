echo "=== First Point Popup Logic Analysis ==="
echo ""
echo "Based on the code analysis, here's how the first point popup works:"
echo ""
echo "üéØ TRIGGER CONDITIONS:"
echo "The popup is triggered when BOTH conditions are met:"
echo "1. hasPerformedFirstAction = false (user hasn't done any action yet)"
echo "2. AND one of these happens:"
echo "   a) isFirstUserAction = true (any positive point earning action except signup bonus)"
echo "   b) isFirstRoutineTask = true (first routine task completion)"
echo ""
echo "üìã SPECIFIC LOGIC:"
echo ""
echo "isFirstUserAction = !hasPerformedFirstAction && reason !== 'Sign up bonus' && delta > 0"
echo "isFirstRoutineTask = reason === 'daily_routine_task' && dailyRoutinePoints === 0 && delta > 0"
echo "shouldTriggerFirstPointPopup = isFirstUserAction || isFirstRoutineTask"
echo ""
echo "üîÑ STATE CHANGES:"
echo "When popup is triggered:"
echo "- hasPerformedFirstAction is set to true"
echo "- This prevents the popup from showing again"
echo ""
echo "üé™ CALLBACK SETUP:"
echo "1. App layout sets empty callback initially"
echo "2. Dashboard screen overrides with actual popup logic"
echo "3. Callback triggers setShowFirstPointPopup(true)"
echo ""
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT NOTES:"
echo "- Signup bonus (250 points) does NOT trigger first point popup"
echo "- Only the first user action OR first routine task triggers it"
echo "- Once hasPerformedFirstAction = true, popup never shows again"
echo "- The popup is shown only ONCE EVER per user"
echo ""
echo "üß™ TEST SCENARIOS:"
echo ""
echo "Scenario 1 - New user completes first routine task:"
echo "  - dailyRoutinePoints = 0"
echo "  - hasPerformedFirstAction = false"
echo "  - earn(1, 'daily_routine_task') called"
echo "  - isFirstRoutineTask = true"
echo "  - shouldTriggerFirstPointPopup = true"
echo "  - ‚úÖ POPUP SHOWS"
echo "  - hasPerformedFirstAction = true"
echo ""
echo "Scenario 2 - New user does any other action first:"
echo "  - hasPerformedFirstAction = false"
echo "  - earn(1, 'daily_check_in') called"
echo "  - isFirstUserAction = true"
echo "  - shouldTriggerFirstPointPopup = true"
echo "  - ‚úÖ POPUP SHOWS"
echo "  - hasPerformedFirstAction = true"
echo ""
echo "Scenario 3 - User already performed first action:"
echo "  - hasPerformedFirstAction = true"
echo "  - earn(1, 'daily_routine_task') called"
echo "  - isFirstUserAction = false"
echo "  - isFirstRoutineTask = false (dailyRoutinePoints > 0)"
echo "  - shouldTriggerFirstPointPopup = false"
echo "  - ‚ùå NO POPUP"
echo ""
echo "Press Enter to continue..."

echo "‚úÖ CONCLUSION:"
echo "The first point popup shows exactly ONCE per user, for their very first"
echo "point-earning action (excluding signup bonus). It's designed to celebrate"
echo "the user's first engagement with the point system."

# Corrected Daily Check-in Popup Rules

## 🎯 **Updated Logic**

The check-in popup now follows these corrected rules:

### **Rule 1: Check-in Status**
- ✅ **Show**: User has NOT checked in today
- ❌ **Hide**: User has already checked in today

### **Rule 2: Popup History (Same Day)**
- ✅ **Show**: Popup has NOT been shown today
- ❌ **Hide**: Popup has already been shown today

### **Rule 3: New Day Protection (4am Rule)**
- ✅ **Show**: If it's a new day and popup wasn't shown yesterday
- ❌ **Hide**: If it's a new day (before 4am) and popup was shown yesterday
- **Purpose**: Prevents showing popup for new day until after 4am

## 📅 **Detailed Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: User Signs Up at 11:59 PM**
- **Time**: 11:59 PM (Day 1)
- **Status**: Never checked in
- **Popup History**: None
- **Result**: ✅ **Popup Shows** (same day, no 4am restriction)

### **Scenario 2: User Opens App at 12:00 AM (Next Day)**
- **Time**: 12:00 AM (Day 2)
- **Status**: Haven't checked in today
- **Popup History**: Shown yesterday (Day 1)
- **Result**: ❌ **No Popup** (new day before 4am, popup shown yesterday)

### **Scenario 3: User Opens App at 4:00 AM (Next Day)**
- **Time**: 4:00 AM (Day 2)
- **Status**: Haven't checked in today
- **Popup History**: Shown yesterday (Day 1)
- **Result**: ✅ **Popup Shows** (new day after 4am)

### **Scenario 4: User Opens App at 2:00 AM (Same Day)**
- **Time**: 2:00 AM (Day 1)
- **Status**: Haven't checked in today
- **Popup History**: None
- **Result**: ✅ **Popup Shows** (same day, no 4am restriction)

### **Scenario 5: User Opens App at 1:00 AM (New Day, No Previous Popup)**
- **Time**: 1:00 AM (Day 2)
- **Status**: Haven't checked in today
- **Popup History**: None (never shown before)
- **Result**: ✅ **Popup Shows** (new day, but no previous popup to block)

## 🔄 **Updated Logic Flow**

```typescript
shouldShowDailyPopup: () => {
  const now = dayjs();
  const currentHour = now.hour();
  const today = now.format("YYYY-MM-DD");
  const state = get();
  
  // Rule 1: Don't show if already checked in today
  if (state.hasCheckedInToday()) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Rule 2: Don't show if popup was already shown today
  if (state.lastPopupShownDate === today) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Rule 3: New day protection (4am rule)
  if (currentHour < 4) {
    const yesterday = dayjs().subtract(1, 'day').format("YYYY-MM-DD");
    if (state.lastPopupShownDate === yesterday) {
      // Popup was shown yesterday, and it's now a new day before 4am
      // Don't show until after 4am
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true; // All conditions met
}
```

## 🕐 **Time-Based Examples**

### **Same Day (No 4am Restriction)**
- ✅ **12:00 AM**: Popup can show (if not shown today)
- ✅ **2:00 AM**: Popup can show (if not shown today)
- ✅ **11:59 PM**: Popup can show (if not shown today)

### **New Day (4am Protection)**
- ❌ **12:00 AM**: Blocked if popup shown yesterday
- ❌ **2:00 AM**: Blocked if popup shown yesterday
- ❌ **3:59 AM**: Blocked if popup shown yesterday
- ✅ **4:00 AM**: Can show (new day after 4am)

## 🎭 **Real-World Examples**

### **Example 1: Late Night User**
- **11:58 PM**: User signs up → ✅ Popup shows
- **12:01 AM**: User opens app → ❌ No popup (new day before 4am)
- **4:01 AM**: User opens app → ✅ Popup shows (new day after 4am)

### **Example 2: Early Morning User**
- **1:00 AM**: User signs up → ✅ Popup shows
- **2:00 AM**: User opens app → ❌ No popup (already shown today)
- **12:01 AM next day**: User opens app → ❌ No popup (new day before 4am)
- **4:01 AM next day**: User opens app → ✅ Popup shows

### **Example 3: First Time User**
- **1:00 AM**: User opens app → ✅ Popup shows (no previous popup to block)
- **12:01 AM next day**: User opens app → ❌ No popup (new day before 4am)
- **4:01 AM next day**: User opens app → ✅ Popup shows

## ✅ **Key Improvements**

1. **Same Day Freedom**: Users can get popup at any time on the same day
2. **New Day Protection**: 4am rule only applies to prevent new day popups
3. **No Double Popups**: Prevents showing popup twice in same day
4. **Late Night Support**: Users signing up late at night get their popup immediately

## 🎯 **Summary**

**The popup shows when:**
1. 📝 User hasn't checked in today
2. 🚫 Popup hasn't been shown today
3. ⏰ Either same day OR new day after 4am (if popup was shown yesterday)

**The popup is blocked when:**
1. ✅ User already checked in today
2. 👁️ Popup was already shown today
3. 🌙 New day before 4am AND popup was shown yesterday

This ensures users get their daily check-in popup without being blocked by arbitrary time restrictions on the same day, while still preventing early morning interruptions for new days.

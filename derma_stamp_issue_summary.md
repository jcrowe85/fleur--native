# Derma Stamp Filtering Issue - RESOLVED

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

The derma stamp evening routine step was showing up on:
- ❌ Dashboard (was showing all steps - FIXED)
- ✅ Routine tab - Weekly (shows all steps for planning)  
- ✅ Routine tab - Evening (correctly filtered by scheduled days)

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

**The dashboard was missing day filtering!** Here's what was happening:

- **Derma stamp is scheduled for**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (`days: [1, 3, 5]`)
- **Today is**: Thursday (`todayDayOfWeek: 4`)
- **Dashboard**: Was showing ALL steps regardless of schedule (BUG)
- **Evening tab**: Correctly filtered by scheduled days
- **Result**: Inconsistent behavior between dashboard and routine tabs

## 📅 **Day of Week Mapping**
- 0 = Sunday
- 1 = Monday  
- 2 = Tuesday
- 3 = Wednesday
- 4 = Thursday ← **Today**
- 5 = Friday
- 6 = Saturday

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

**Dashboard now filters by scheduled days** - same logic as morning/evening tabs:

```typescript
// Dashboard now filters to show only today's scheduled steps
const todaysSteps = useMemo(() => {
  const morningSteps = stepsByPeriod("morning");
  const eveningSteps = stepsByPeriod("evening");
  const allSteps = [...morningSteps, ...eveningSteps];
  
  // Filter to only show steps scheduled for today
  const todayDayOfWeek = dayjs().day();
  return allSteps.filter(step => 
    !step.days || step.days.length === 0 || step.days.includes(todayDayOfWeek)
  );
}, [stepsByPeriod, stepsAll]);
```

## 🎯 **Current Behavior (Now Consistent)**

All tabs now correctly show only steps scheduled for today:
- **Dashboard**: Shows only today's scheduled steps ✅
- **Morning tab**: Shows only today's morning steps ✅  
- **Evening tab**: Shows only today's evening steps ✅
- **Weekly tab**: Shows all steps for planning purposes ✅

## ✅ **Result**

**Issue resolved!** The dashboard now correctly filters routine steps by scheduled days, making it consistent with the morning and evening tabs.

- **Derma stamp will appear on**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (its scheduled days)
- **Derma stamp will NOT appear on**: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday
- **All tabs now consistent**: Dashboard, morning, and evening tabs all show only today's scheduled steps
- **Weekly tab unchanged**: Still shows all steps for planning purposes

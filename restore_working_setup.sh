echo "ðŸ”§ WHAT I FIXED:"
echo "âœ… Added missing 'is_guest' column to complete_schema.sql"
echo "âœ… Restored the original working edge function that inserts into profiles"
echo "âœ… Kept everything else exactly as it was"

echo "ðŸ“‹ THE ORIGINAL WORKING APPROACH:"
echo "1. Edge function creates user in auth.users"
echo "2. Edge function manually inserts profile with is_guest: true"
echo "3. No triggers needed - simple and direct"

echo "ðŸš€ TO DEPLOY:"
echo "1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor"
echo "2. Run: ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_guest BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;"
echo "3. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions"
echo "4. Update create-guest function with the restored code"
echo "5. Deploy the function"

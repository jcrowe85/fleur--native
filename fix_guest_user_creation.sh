echo "=== Fixing Guest User Creation ==="
echo ""
echo "🎯 FOUND THE REAL ISSUE!"
echo ""
echo "The problem is that the edge function was trying to manually insert into profiles,"
echo "but the system is designed to work with a TRIGGER that automatically creates"
echo "profiles when users are created in auth.users."
echo ""
echo "🔧 THE FIX:"
echo "1. Edge function should ONLY create the user in auth.users"
echo "2. The trigger should automatically create the profile"
echo "3. No manual profile insertion needed"
echo ""
echo "📋 WHAT I FIXED:"
echo "✅ Removed manual profile insertion from edge function"
echo "✅ Updated trigger function to handle is_guest field"
echo "✅ Edge function now just creates user and returns credentials"
echo ""
echo "🚀 TO DEPLOY:"
echo "1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor"
echo "2. Run the SQL in database/fix_trigger_function.sql"
echo "3. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions"
echo "4. Update the create-guest function with the fixed code"
echo "5. Deploy the function"
echo ""
echo "📝 THE CORRECT FLOW:"
echo "1. Edge function calls auth.admin.createUser()"
echo "2. User is created in auth.users"
echo "3. Trigger automatically creates profile in profiles table"
echo "4. Edge function returns credentials"
echo "5. Client signs in with returned credentials"
echo ""
echo "Press Enter to continue..."

echo "✅ This should fix the foreign key constraint error!"
echo "The trigger will handle profile creation automatically."

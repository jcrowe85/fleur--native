echo ""
echo "After reviewing the entire codebase, I can see that:"
echo "â€¢ The codebase expects 'user_id' as the main identifier"
echo "â€¢ Most queries use 'user_id' (ProfileScreen, firstTimeUser, etc.)"
echo "â€¢ The edge function is trying to insert 'user_id: userId'"
echo "â€¢ But the current profiles table doesn't have a 'user_id' column"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ”§ THE FIX:"
echo "1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor"
echo "2. Run the SQL in database/fix_missing_user_id.sql"
echo ""
echo "This will:"
echo "âœ… Add the missing 'user_id' column"
echo "âœ… Populate existing rows with user_id = id"
echo "âœ… Make 'user_id' the primary key (what the codebase expects)"
echo "âœ… Make 'id' nullable (since it's not the primary key)"
echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ This matches what the entire codebase expects!"
echo "All the queries use 'user_id', so that should be the primary key."
echo ""
echo "Press Enter to continue..."

echo "âœ… Run the SQL to add the missing user_id column that the codebase expects."

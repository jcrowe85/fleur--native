echo "ðŸŽ¯ FOUND THE EXACT ISSUE!"
echo ""
echo "The problem was:"
echo "â€¢ id is the PRIMARY KEY (not nullable)"
echo "â€¢ user_id is nullable and has NULL values"
echo "â€¢ Edge function was only providing user_id, not id"
echo "â€¢ Since id is required (primary key), it failed"

echo "âœ… THE FIX:"
echo "Updated the edge function to provide BOTH id and user_id:"
echo "  { id: userId, user_id: userId, handle, is_guest: true, avatar_url: null }"

echo "ðŸš€ TO DEPLOY:"
echo "1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions"
echo "2. Update the create-guest function with the fixed code"
echo "3. Deploy the function"
